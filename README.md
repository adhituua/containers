# [DBHI] Dynamic Binary Hardware Injection: docker images

This repository contains containerized open and free development tools for decoupled functional hardware-software co-design on SoCs with FPGA, through injection of compiled HDL designs using binary modification.

All the images currently available at [hub.docker.com/r/aptman/dbhi](https://hub.docker.com/r/aptman/dbhi/) are based on `Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic)`. Images provided by [docker-library/official-images](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#architectures-other-than-amd64) are used for `amd64`, `arm64v8` and `arm32v7` platforms.

Manifest images are also provided, in order to allow platform-agnostic development.
